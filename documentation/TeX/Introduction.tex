This work is focused on introducing the Cellular neural networks (CNN) to the reader as such it is separated into several sections. First some theoretical introduction to the field of CNN , some information about the origins and explanations of how they work and their applications. Second part of this work is dedicated to an experiments that are supposed to show basic capabilities of CNN followed up by an chapter about the practical implementation of the supporting program and it's usage. 


\subsection{Cellular neural networks}
Cellular Neural Networks (CNNs) is analog, continuous time, non-linear dynamic
systems and formally belongs to the class of recurrent Neural Networks. Since
their introduction in 1988 by Chua and Yang \cite{Chua-Yang} they have been the subjects of
intense research. \\
